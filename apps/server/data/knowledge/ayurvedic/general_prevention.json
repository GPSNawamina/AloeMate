      "title": "Establish proper Vastu placement",
      "description": "Place aloe plants in the North or East direction of your home or garden (following Vastu Shastra principles). These directions receive gentle morning sunlight (Pitta energy without excess) and promote healthy growth. Avoid South-West placement which can create excess heat (Pitta aggravation).",

Mix: 40% regular soil, 30% coarse sand, 20% dried cow dung (gomay), 10% neem cake powder. This combination prevents water stagnation (Kapha excess) while providing gentle nutrition.",

      "description": "Water only during morning hours (6-10 AM, Kapha time ending) when sun's Agni begins rising. This timing allows water to be properly assimilated. Use sun-charged water (water left in copper vessel in sunlight for 3 hours) which has enhanced Prana. Water at soil level only, never on leaves. Allow complete drying between waterings.",

      "description": "Ensure good air circulation (Vata element) around plants - prevents stagnation (Kapha aggravation). Provide 6-8 hours indirect sunlight (Pitta energy for growth). Keep environment relatively dry - high humidity aggravates Kapha. In rainy season, provide extra ventilation and reduce watering significantly.",

Check for early signs of dosha imbalance: excess moisture (Kapha), dry brittleness (Vata), spots or heat (Pitta). Early detection allows gentle correction.",

In Varsha (monsoon) and Sharad (autumn), reduce water as Kapha increases. In Hemant and Shishir (winter), provide warmth and minimal water. Following natural cycles prevents seasonal diseases.",

  "traditional_note": "Ayurvedic plant care views plants as living beings with consciousness and energy (Prana). Prevention focuses on maintaining dosha balance, enhancing vital force, and creating harmonious growing conditions. These practices integrate physical, energetic, and spiritual dimensions of plant health. While rooted in ancient wisdom, modern research is beginning to validate mechanisms like antimicrobial herb properties, beneficial microorganism enhancement, and plant response to environmental energy. For optimal results, combine Ayurvedic holistic approach with practical modern knowledge of plant physiology and disease prevention."
