  "treatment_steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "title": "Immediately cease watering",
      "description": "Stop all watering. Root rot represents Kapha dosha excess - too much water element creating cold, heavy, stagnant conditions. The soil must dry completely to restore balance. This period allows Vata (air) and Agni (fire) elements to return.",

      "step_number": 2,
      "title": "Gently remove plant and offer prayers",
      "description": "Carefully remove plant from pot with reverence. Offer prayer for the plant's recovery. Gently brush away soil to expose roots. Healthy roots are firm and light-colored (balanced Kapha). Diseased roots are dark, soft, and foul-smelling (Kapha vitiation with Ama - toxins).",

    {
      "step_number": 3,
      "title": "Remove diseased roots and apply purifying herbs",
      "description": "Using a clean blade, remove all dark, mushy roots back to healthy tissue. Apply turmeric powder (Haridra) directly to cut surfaces - it pacifies excess Kapha and purifies Ama. Can also apply paste of neem powder mixed with turmeric. These herbs are heating (Ushna) and drying (Ruksha), opposing excess Kapha qualities.",

      "description": "Prepare decoction: Boil 2 tablespoons triphala powder in 1 liter water for 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature, strain. Soak remaining healthy roots in this Triphala wash for 30 minutes. Triphala balances all doshas and has astringent (Kashaya) properties that strengthen tissues and remove Ama.",

      "step_number": 5,
      "title": "Sun-dry for restoration of Agni",
      "description": "Place treated plant in indirect sunlight with good air circulation for 3-7 days. This allows solar Agni (fire element) to dry and heal tissues, restoring balance. The cut surfaces will form protective callus. During this period, you may recite healing mantras for plants.",

      "description": "Mix potting soil with generous amounts of sand (at least 40%) and small pieces of cow dung (dried). Add handful of neem cake powder. This creates a light (Laghu), dry (Ruksha) medium opposing Kapha's heavy (Guru) and wet (Snigdha) qualities. Optionally add pinch of rock salt for mineral balance.",

      "description": "Wait 7-10 days before first watering. Then water only when soil is completely dry. Water in morning when sun is rising (Pitta time), never in evening (Kapha time). Use water that has been boiled and cooled, or water exposed to sunlight for 3 hours (energized water). Add pinch of turmeric to water monthly.",

  "safety_warnings": [
    "ONLY use cow products from healthy, organically-raised animals - commercial products may contain harmful substances",

    "Turmeric will stain hands and clothes - wear old clothing or gloves",
    "Do NOT use salt in excess - very small amounts only, as it can harm plant if overdone",
    "Cow urine must be from fresh, healthy source - if unavailable, skip this step rather than use questionable source",
    "Sun-drying must be in indirect light - direct harsh sun will damage already-stressed plant",
    "These traditional methods work best when combined with proper modern sanitation practices",
    "Dispose of diseased material properly - do not compost or leave near other plants"

    "Multiple plants show root rot simultaneously - may indicate systemic issue",
    "You cannot source authentic Ayurvedic ingredients (triphala, pure turmeric, neem)",
    "Plant shows no improvement after 4 weeks of treatment",
    "You want professional guidance on combining Ayurvedic and modern treatment approaches",
    "The plant has significant monetary or sentimental value and you want expert assessment"

  "traditional_note": "Root rot in Ayurvedic understanding represents severe Kapha imbalance with Ama accumulation. Treatment focuses on increasing Agni (digestive/transformative fire), reducing excess water element, and purifying toxins. These methods have been used in traditional agriculture for centuries. Modern scientific research is beginning to validate several mechanisms, particularly the antimicrobial properties of key herbs. For best results, combine Ayurvedic wisdom with proper sanitation and drainage practices."
