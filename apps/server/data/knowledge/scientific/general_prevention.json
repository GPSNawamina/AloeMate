      "step_number": 1,
      "title": "Optimize soil drainage",
      "description": "Use a well-draining potting mix specifically formulated for cacti and succulents. Mix should contain at least 30% inorganic material (perlite, pumice, coarse sand). Ensure pots have adequate drainage holes (minimum 3-4 holes for 6-inch pot).",

      "step_number": 2,
      "title": "Practice proper watering technique",
      "description": "Water deeply but infrequently. Allow soil to dry completely between waterings (check 2 inches down). Typical schedule: every 2-3 weeks in growing season, monthly in dormancy. Always water at soil level, never on leaves. Empty saucers immediately after watering.",

      "step_number": 3,
      "title": "Ensure adequate light and air circulation",
      "description": "Provide bright, indirect light for 6-8 hours daily. Avoid intense direct sun which can stress plants. Space plants 12-18 inches apart. For indoor plants, use a small fan to ensure air circulation, reducing humidity around leaves.",

      "step_number": 4,
      "title": "Conduct regular health inspections",

      "title": "Practice strict sanitation",
      "description": "Always use sterilized tools when pruning (70% isopropyl alcohol or 10% bleach). Wash hands before and after handling plants. Isolate new plants for 2 weeks before introducing to collection. Never reuse soil from diseased plants.",
